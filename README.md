# Prawn_fisheries_Public_health
Code repository for project connecting prawn fisheries model to schisto epidemiological model

## Prawn_aquaculture  
Contains scripts for the prawn aquaculture model, simulations, and plots  

## Epi_model  
Contains scripts for the schisto epidemiological model, simulations, and plots  

## neg_binom_fit  
Contains data and a small script to estimate parameters of the negative binomial distribution from egg burden data from Senegal  

## functional_response_fit
Script and data used to fit parameters of Hollings disk equation which models predation of snails by prawns and links the prawn aquaculture model to the schisto epi model

## Combined model  
Contains scripts for the combined model which links the aquaculture model to the schisto epi model via the predation function
