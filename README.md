# Prawn_fisheries_Public_health
Code repository for project connecting prawn fisheries model to schisto epidemiologic model

## R  
Contains scripts for the prawn aquaculture model, the schisto epidemiological model, and the combined model which links the aquaculture model to the schisto epi model via the predation function; model functions and simulation functions  

## Data  
Contains parameter sets for each component of the model and data used for fitting the model   

## Analysis
Contains R Markdown scripts to reproduce each segment of the analysis (prawn aquaculture, schisto epidemiologic, and sensitivity analysis)
