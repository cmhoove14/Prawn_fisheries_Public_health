# Description  
This folder contains scripts, plots, and simulations for the prawn aquaculture model simulating dynamics of M. rosenbergii and M. volenvenhovenii under repeated stocking amd harvesting events  

## `prawn_aquaculture_mod.R`  
Contains the base model with state variables number of prawns, P, and average prawn length, L; prawn model parameters; sample starting conditions; and a run to equilibrium

## `macrobrachium_aquaculture_data.R`  
Data from Ranjeet and Kurup 2006 on M. rosenbergii stocking trials at different densities used to derive density dependence and marketable biomass from the harvest for the prawn aquaculture model
