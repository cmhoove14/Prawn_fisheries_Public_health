# Description  
Schisto epidemiological model with infection and size stratified snail population that gives rise to adult worms harbored in definitive human hosts. Simulations and plots to explore dynamics

## `snail_epi_mod_no_diag`  
Epidemiological model simulating infection and growth dynamics across three infection states and three size classes with all vertical and horizontal transitions possible, but no diagonal transitions based on the assumption that it is unlikely on a daily time scale for a particular snail to transition in both growth and infection status  

## `snail_epi_no_diag_plots`  
Plots snail infection and size dynamics based on the model in mod script  

## `snail_size_class_only`  
Simulate and plot size dynamics of snail population to estimate mean life expectancy absent infection  

## `snail_epi mod` & `snail_epi_plots`  
Old scripts of model with misinformed diagonal transitions in the model  

## `snail_epi_life_expectancy`  
Simulations and tweaks to snail mortality parameters to get life expectancy and size/infection dynamics right  

## `snail_epi_sensitivity`  
Sensitivity analysis of epidemiological model
