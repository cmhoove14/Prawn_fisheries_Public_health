# Description  
This folder contains scripts, plots, and simulations for the integrated prawn aquaculture - schistosomiasis epidemiological model simulating dynamics of M. rosenbergii and M. volenvenhovenii under repeated stocking amd harvesting events as well as snail population, size and infection dynamics and worm burden in human population
